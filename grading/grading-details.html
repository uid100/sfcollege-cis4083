        <p><strong>Complete all work on time.</strong></p>
        <p>All work must be submitted to Canvas according to the assignment instructions. The instructor cannot submit
            "Attachments" to comments on behalf of students, and they are not queued for grading.</p>
        <p>Turn in all Projects on the due date by the time and method indicated in the instructions. Meeting due dates
            and deadlines is a sign of professionalism and is expected of all students and employees.</p>
        <p>The schedule for all of the required work - discussions, projects, and exams - is clearly posted in Canvas
            and any changes made to it will be shared in advance. Life events and computer access interruptions happen.
            Plan for what you can, and start assignments early, to anticipate and mitigate what you can't control.</p>
        <p>Simple terms, <strong>complete all work on time.</strong> Exceptions happen. read more <a

    <dt>Plagiarism</dt>
    <dd>
        <p><em>Please note that I hate that this needs to be included.</em></p>
        <p>Plagiarism hurts your personal &amp; professional reputation, the personal &amp; professional reputation of
            others, and the reputation of the college. Unless specified otherwise, all assignments in this class are to
            be completed and turned in on an individual basis. Even in the software industry, where most projects are
            done in a team environment, team members are expected to contribute substantial original effort to their
            assigned portion(s) of a project. Information technology professionals are expected to work to a high
            professional and ethical standard.</p>
        <p><strong> The bottom line: You will not gain any benefit from this course if someone else is doing the work
                and thinking for you. Plagiarism will not help get you ahead in future classes that build upon this one
                nor will it help you get ahead in the workplace! </strong></p>
        <p>You are encouraged to share ideas and help each other but outright copying another's work (source code,
            documentation, etc.) will result in a zero score for all parties involved. Repeated offenses may result in
            referral for disciplinary action pursuant to the College guidelines for discipline in plagiarism matters. If
            you use the campus lab computers, make sure you take your personal storage media with you when you leave and
            don't leave hard copy source code/documentation lying around the lab or store your files in publicly
            accessible network folders.</p>
