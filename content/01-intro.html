<div id="discussion-introductions">
    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Introductions</h3>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Since we don't have the opportunity to go around the classroom and have people introduce themselves, we're going to do an online introduction and share a little bit about ourselves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>(5 pts) Add your picture to your Canvas profile. From the Canvas main menu (typically on the upper left side of your screen), select Account and go to Settings and upload a picture. <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-profile-picture-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/518" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Canvas Student Guide</a></li>
        <li>(40 pts) Click reply below, and add a post introducing yourself to the class. Share at least one or two good paragraphs so others in the class can find some things in common with you. Ideas might include: what you currently do, your major, why you are taking this class, what you would like to do after you finish your degree, hobbies, special interests, where you're originally from, where you live (general area), family, etc. You can upload pictures if you want to. What's your Discord username and why did you choose it?
