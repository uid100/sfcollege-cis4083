            <strong>Important:</strong> Your college-issued <strong>student EDU Azure Active Directory (AAD) 
                email account</strong> is for Microsoft 365/Email access and 
            <strong>may not support the Azure cloud services needed in this class</strong>.  
            You will need to create a <strong>separate personal Azure cloud account</strong> to complete class 
            exercises.

            <p><em>How do you pronounce "Azure?"</em></p>
            <p>Most people have very strong opinions about this. There are two common pronunciations 
                and <strong>both are acceptable</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Azure</strong> is from the french word <em>azuré</em>, and is very much a part of the 
                English language. The preferred common pronunciation within the United States is 
                <em><strong>AZH</strong>-uhr</em>, while in the UK the emphasis is more commonly on the 
                second syllable, <em>az-<strong>ZHOOR</strong></em>.</p>
            <p><em>But which do they use at Microsoft?</em></p>
            <p>Having many friends and associates working at and for Microsoft and the Azure team, I can 
                tell you first-hand that there really isn't a consensus. In Redmond, the American pronunciation 
                is more common, and I have worked with Microsoft employees in Canada who unsurprisingly 
                preferred the French pronunciation more common in the UK.</p>
            <p>So, which should you use? Either is acceptable, but before you take a stand, neither is 
                <em>incorrect.</em></p>
