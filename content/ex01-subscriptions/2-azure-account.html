                <p><em>How do you pronounce "Azure?"</em></p>
                <p>Most people have very strong opinions about this. There are two common pronunciations and <strong>both are acceptable</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Azure</strong> is from the french word azure, and is very much a part of the English language. The preferred common pronunciation within the United States is <em><strong>AZH</strong>-uhr</em>, while in the UK the emphasis is more commonly on the second syllable, <em>az-<strong>ZHOOR</strong></em>.</p>
                <p><em>But which do they use at Microsoft?</em></p>
                <p>Having many friends and associates working at and for Microsoft and the Azure team, I can tell you first-hand that there really isn't a consensus. In Redmond, the American pronunciation is more common, and I have worked with Microsoft employees in Canada who unsurprisingly preferred the French pronunciation more common in the UK.</p>
                <p>So, which should you use? Either is acceptable, but before you take a stand, neither is <em>incorrect.</em></p>
