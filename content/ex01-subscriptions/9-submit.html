            <h2 class="alert alert-info">Screenshots</h2>
            <p>Create the account in each of the cloud service providers as described.</p>
            <p>Next, login to your account and take a screenshot showing the main dashboard and your active account.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Here is an example logged into the Azure Portal. This was using the Google Chrome browser on a Macbook Pro</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/501032/files/60115192/preview" alt="Azure portal on Mac" width="800" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/501032/files/60115192" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And another, this time also using Chrome on a Windows 11 notebook.</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/501032/files/60115164/preview" alt="AWS dashboard from Windows" width="600" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/501032/files/60115164" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> when you take your screenshots, size the window down to something reasonable and clip only the relevant content.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Do not use Print Screen.</em></strong></p>
            <p>With <strong>MacOS</strong>, use <strong>shift-command-4</strong> and click and drag the crosshair across the required area.</p>
            <p>Using <strong>Windows</strong>, use the <strong>Snipping Tool</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Save your screenshots as common image formats, I prefer jpeg (.jpg), Portable Network Graphic (.png) is also fine. It is the default from the Mac capture.</p>
            <p>Upload both of these files to Canvas. If you are having difficulty submitting both files, you may zip them into a single (not individual) zip archive file. Do not use tar or cpio or 7zip or any other compression tool. These image files are already compact formats, so uploading the original image files is preferred. Do not attach them to the Canvas Comment window. I will not see the attachments.</p>
