                At the end of this module, you should be able to explain and give 
                examples of cloud service types and distinguish SaaS, IaaS, and 
                PaaS.

        <h3><em>Why?</em></h3>
        <p>
            In the last module, we talked about what the cloud is an about the concept of 
            outsourcing common services to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you needed to fly from New York City to London, you probably would not start 
            by building a plane and hiring someone to fly it, instead you could identify 
            one of several passenger air carriers which provide that service and buy a 
            ticket to fly on one of their airplanes.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you then needed to go on to Paris or Frankfurt, you could simply buy another 
            ticket and fly there.
        </p>
        <p>
            To extend the metaphor, if you needed to fly your entire team to another city, 
            you would have the option of chartering an entire plane to take them on that flight. 
            But you only pay for the flights that you need, and you rely on the flight crew to 
            fly the plane and the ground crew to keep up with maintenance and fuel and other 
            operations of airplane and airline management.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, if you need more computing power, you can simply configure your cloud 
            services to deliver more capability for the time that you need it and turn it off 
            when the project ends.

            In this course, we will leverage resources from the industry and dive into real-world 
            situations and apply real-world solutions. The intent is to form a good understanding 
            of the cloud in general terms, as an architecture and business model and systems 
            solution. In the course of exploring hands-on examples, you will see differences in 
            the way things are accomplished from one provider to the next and even how they are 
            named, but try to identify the similarities in the services and the architectures.
