                Four cloud deployment models are widely recognized: public clouds, private clouds:
                <li><strong>Public Cloud:</strong> Services are delivered over the public internet and shared across organizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Private Cloud:</strong> Cloud infrastructure is operated solely for a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third party.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Cloud:</strong> Infrastructure is shared among several organizations with common concerns, such as security or compliance requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud:</strong> A combination of two or more cloud deployment models, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.</li>
            </ul>
        <div>
            A cloud deployment model is defined according to where the infrastructure for the 
            deployment resides and who has control over that infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Questions to consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the relationship of overhead to deployment model?</li>
            <li>Which do you think represents the <em>most</em> secure? Is it a different answer for different applications?</li>
            <li>Aside from initial investment, what are the factors which might drive continuing operating costs for each one?</li>
            <li>What are compelling reasons for selecting one over another?</li>
            <li>Can you think of applications which would be best-fit for each of the four (or five)?</li>
        </ul>
