        <p>In the last modules, you read about different cloud services and applications for them.</p>

        <h2 class="alert alert-info">A Look Back</h2>

        <p>You learned that the cloud metaphor was originally used to abstract the complexities of network details. 
            The <em>cloud</em> was adopted as a simplified drawing to indicate a <em>cloudy</em> reality for real 
            infrastructure but the details could be obscured or hidden because those details weren't important to 
            the context of the drawing(s) where this technique was being used.</p>
        <p>This vague idea of the cloud was similar to the use of a <em>black box</em> in engineering where a magic 
            container is presented which hides the details of a particular system or process. Yes, there are things 
            happening in there, but instead of looking inside, focus is on the inputs and results.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Cloud computing services as an industry, was born following the dotcom bubble. 
            <a style="color: navy;" href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/d/dot-com-bubble-and-burst"> 
                You can read about the economic climate of the time here. </a></p>
        <p>Tech stocks in the stock market showed unprecedented and unsustainable gains.</p>
        <p>The internet was becoming a household reality. In the early days of the internet, domain name registration 
            was more regulated than it is today. Primary domain extensions were more limited and assignment was less 
            arbitrary. As you would expect, <em>.gov</em> and <em>.edu</em> extensions were reserved for qualified 
            government and educational institutions. <em>.net</em> was reserved for communications companies, <em>.org</em> 
            suggested not-for-profit organizations and <em>.com</em> was the extension that indicated commerce. In those 
            days, network presence, and a <em>web-page</em> carried a perception of legitimacy.</p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info"><em> Of course it's a real company,<br />they've got a website and everything! </em></p>
        <p>The market responded. Established tech companies and startups with a good story were attracting investors 
            and speculators, and there seemed there was no end in sight. Of course it's called a bubble for a reason. 
            And when the hype met its logical conclusion, many companies were faced with dusting off and finding 
            creative ways to survive.</p>
        <p>Amazon was one of those companies. This was a company that started as an online bookstore. This alone was 
            an unusual idea. Book shoppers traditionally wanted to go to bookstores. To the demographic, the book 
            shopping experience suggested colorful displays, peaceful, warm, quiet places to leaf through pages of 
            bound treasures. Many thought the idea of ordering a book on the internet that you had never held and 
            looked at, simply couldn't catch on.</p>
        <p>Of course there was more to it. Mall real estate, the haven of traditional bookstores, was expensive. 
            And the market for affordable books reached beyond the mall. Best seller lists could be leveraged into 
            order opportunities. For a while, Amazon was quietly successful. There was even a very public lawsuit 
            filed by Barnes and Noble Booksellers when Amazon claimed to be the "world's largest bookstore."</p>
        <h3>A Turning Point</h3>
        <p>
            <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"

            alt="Downward line graph" width="250" height="267" /></p>
        <p>As an e-commerce, dot-com company, Amazon was also on that economic ride and shares of their stock climbed 
            to around $113 in 1999 and tumbled back to about $5 two years later when the market correction occurred. 
            But through this, Amazon grew. There is a lot of interesting business logic for why their business model 
            was working, even when indicators might have suggested otherwise.</p>
        <p>But here was a growing e-commerce player, expanding their business model to other products, selling inventory 
            they didn't need to own, and collecting payments in realtime. Their relative available investment revenue 
            was very healthy. And here was the distinction, they continued to invest in their online footprint and 
            while others were considering that the rising cost of entry to internet commerce was prohibitive, Amazon 
            was perfectly positioned with infrastucture in place when this new concept of offering computing services 
            was conceived and Amazon Web Services or AWS was created.</p>

        <h2 class="alert alert-info">What Services?</h2>
        <p>In the last module you researched some of the larger Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Internet Service Providers 
            (ISPs) had existed for a while as access points for consumers to join the network. Cloud computing services was 
            bringing a new idea of accessing remote resources with little to no capital investment for individual server 
            infrastructure.</p>
        <p>As you discovered in the last module, there are many companies providing these shared services, but just a few 
            that are set apart from the others, most notably AWS, and Microsoft's Azure both have a strong lead in global 
            market share and the third spot has shifted a few times in recent years.</p>
        <p>Considering what we know about how the industry has grown, this likely does not come as a surprise. <em>In my 
            opinion,</em> AWS is the largest player, largely because they were the first player and heavily invested in 
            the capability.</p>
        <p>It is my intent to provide you with an unbiased picture of the industry and encourage you to draw your own 
            conclusions from what you find on your own. My opinions can't help but be influenced by my own experience and 
            observations. AWS, Microsoft, and Google are major companies and industry leaders. They are not the only ones, 
            they are the largest.</p>
        <p>I am repeating this because some of the materials that you will find and that I will share with you are 
            unapologetically branded by one of these companies. They are not sponsors of this course, and I hope that you 
            leave with a broad view of the technology, but I also won't avoid using some of these obviously brand-specific 
            materials, and even some of their training media because a lot of it is quite good, helpful, and informative.</p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">I will try to use <strong>AWS</strong> to distinguish it from the giant e-commerce parent 
            company, <strong>Amazon</strong></p>
        <p>I've described a little of the historical context which led to AWS becoming a leader in this new industry. It is 
            worth taking a look at some of the technical background also.</p>
        <p>As part of their recovery, Amazon began working to refactor their code in order to step in as a vendor to host 
            other retailers, by decoupling their code tp support this new approach.</p>
        <p>At first, this <em>service as a product</em> was a set of APIs for accessing the Amazon retail catalog and soon 
            remotely hosted data storage, they called this first product <strong>Simple Storage Service</strong> or simply 
            <strong>S3</strong>.</p>
        <p>Amazon (soon AWS) continued to develop service offerings including their messaging API (Simple Queue Service or 
            SQS) and infrastructure computing resources, known as the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) which 
            enabled organizations to lease computing resources and scaling up and down (elastic) or using more or less 
            services as their needs changed. More products followed and service expanded to Europe.</p>
        <p>As web technologies were evolving in parallel, Google began offering computing services to integrate into hosted 
            web applications called the <strong>Google App Engine</strong>.</p>
        <p>After more years of growth and development passed, software giant Microsoft launched their competing Azure cloud 
            service around 2010.</p>
        <h2 class="alert alert-info">Cloud Computing</h2>
        <p>More than just web hosting or online storage; now, with a better understanding of the terms and concepts, take another 
            look at just what these <em>cloud computing services</em> can do.</p>
