            At the top of several of the previous course pages, I have included <em>a</em> definition of Cloud Computing. 
            Without referring back to it, can you remember what it said?
        </p>
        <p 
            class="boxed-paragraph" 
            title="Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, 
                    applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.">
            <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> is ...<br /><br />

            This definition describes highly available delivery of IT services. In the last module, I included a video in which included 
            a discussion of cloud computing services in terms of three layers, Software, Infrastructure and Platform. If you skipped over 
            this, or just want to watch it again (6 minutes) it is repeated below.

            These <em>layers</em> commonly map to <em>service types</em> or categories. Specifically Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), 
            Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Sometimes, collectively these cloud computing services are referred 
            to as Anything-as-a-Service and abbreviated (XaaS).

        <h3 class="alert">AWS: Types of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p>
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) differentiates these as <em>Cloud Computing Models.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/">here</a>
            (https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/) is a brief description.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            <em>Why is this important?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding the different service models will drive engineering solution and architecture decisions. 
            The different models are similar to the differences between a renting a car, riding on a transit bus, 
            or using a ride-sharing service. All three solutions will carry a passenger from point to point, but 
            all three have different planning and operational decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a rental car, you will need to be capable of operating the vehicle in the intended environment, 
            and while your maintenance costs are minimal operating costs such as gas, tolls, and parking are your 
            responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a city bus, you can join a planned route at particular points and ride between stops, but you 
            will need to have knowledge of the route and any required transfers. The cost of usage is very low but 
            the flexibility of destinations in most cases will be the most limited.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ride-share services have gained popularity in recent years and are available in major cities worldwide. 
            With this option, the user has great flexibility to specify origin and destination, the user avoids all 
            maintenance and operating costs and in many cases may have less flexibility than the rental car, but for 
            short distances, this can be a very affordable option.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, if your engineering solution requires a global internet available web application which relies 
            on business data managed and stored in a database with access limited to authorized users then the solution 
            might include building a database on a cloud-based database (PaaS) server, hosting a web application as 
            another one or more web application or Application Programming Interface (API) (PaaS) services, and 
            integrating with in Identification-as-a-Service (IDaaS) run by another provider as a Software-as-a-Service 
            (SaaS). This multi-tiered solution may be running on the same or multiple cloud providers such as AWS 
            or Microsoft Azure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, the same solution could involve employing a cloud-based virtual machine (vm) and installing 
            and configuring database software, a web server, and writing software to authenticate user with password 
            encryption and multi-factor authentication stored in a separate database. Using this Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
            (IaaS) will give the engineering team the most control over every aspect of the installation, but require the 
            most responsibility for ensuring all of the applications are patched to acceptable security levels and that 
            all of the individual software licenses are maintained.
