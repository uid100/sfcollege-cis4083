        <h3>All of <em>Us</em></h3>
        <em>Really? Again?</em> (Yes, of course.)
        <ul style="margin-left: 10%;">
            <li>In polite society, we meet and introduce ourselves. It's not a bad thing.<br />And I have a Discussion board set up just for that purpose. (<em>Hey, you can get easy points for it!</em>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>All of <em>This</em></h3>
        <em>How is this going to work?</em>
        <p>First, there are no scheduled meetings. Except of course optional office hours. But you won't be doing this alone. Office hours are a great place to check in, ask questions, or just visit. <strong>Discord</strong> is a good virtual meeting place, and a great place to ask and answer questions and share ideas. And it's always there!</p>
        <p>This course is designed to be very much a <em>hands-on</em> experience. You will be expected to search for solutions when you run into a challenge and try to apply them. There will be some reading and some videos and some quizzes to evaluate a <em>conversational</em> level of understanding ("can you talk about the subject and recognize the terminology?"), and more importantly there will be opportunities to see and touch and use the technology.</p>
        <p>One of my objectives is that this course reliably present the current state of the industry. (Really. Today!)</p>
        <p>That is one of the primary reasons that there is no <em>printed</em> textbook. There will be a lot of outside referenced resources, papers and videos. When you see these, it is strongly recommended that you consider the age of the resource.</p>
        <p>Given the recent and rapid evolution of this topic, if you want to discover what it looks like today, then let's look at it.</p>
        <p><em>What about certificates?</em></p>
        <p>Certificates certainly have value and add credibility to a resume as a means to support knowledge claims. This course is intended to provide an introduction to cloud computing and cloud technologies. We will be surveying different approaches to solving similar problems using different vendors. (<em>read that sentence again.</em>) This course will better equip you to pursue one of the many worthwhile cloud certificates, but without the focused detail that they require. This is more about understanding the <em>what</em> and the <em>why.</em></p>

        <p><em>I found an #ERROR!</em></p>
        <p>Yes. There are probably a few. This is an evolving course and much of what you are seeing is very much a work in progress. If you have questions or find something that just doesn't make sense, it may well be that something is missing, incorrect, images not appearing, broken links, or something that could just be clearer. Please let me know. Peer review and constructive feedback is always appreciated.</p>
