                <h2>VPNs</h2>
                <p>A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection between a device and the internet. This connection allows users to transmit sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, securely over the internet. VPNs also hide a user's internet protocol (IP) address and location, making it more difficult for websites, internet service providers, and advertisers to track the user's online activity.</p>
                <p>VPNs are often used by individuals and businesses to protect their online privacy and security, especially when accessing the internet from public Wi-Fi networks. They can also be used to access restricted websites and content, such as streaming services that are not available in certain countries. VPNs can be set up on a user's computer, mobile device, or router, and there are also many VPN services available as subscription-based services.</p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <h3>Local trust</h3>
                <p>As business reliance on networks has grown over the years, so has the concern about privacy and data security. It is generally accepted that computers that are connected to the local internal network are more <em>trustworthy</em> than unknown external systems. For this reason, there are Firewalls and other digital and physical safeguards in place to keep unknown or unwelcome traffic from the internal local network.</p>
                <p>A virtual private network connection can be established between two computers by establishing trust between them and creating a digital <em>tunnel</em> and encrpyting all network traffic between them. This trusted connection is assigned a network address to <em>appear</em> as if the traffic is coming from a computer that is connected directly to the local network.</p>
                <p>Because of this trust relationship, employees can use their company computers from remote locations, whether at home, hotel rooms, coffee shops, or customer facilities, and by establishing the dedicated connection, traffic flowing between them is considered reasonably secure from interception by outside listeners.</p>
