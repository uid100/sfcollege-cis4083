            <p>Often, system engineers have a need for either physical or logical network diagrams either for describing existing infrastructure, or designing new capabilities.</p>
            <p>Typically, these diagrams are representations, or abstractions. In other words they are useful to record and communicate important elements and mask less relevant details.</p>
            <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/501032/files/60115258/preview" alt="simple network diagram" width="480" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/501032/files/60115258" data-api-returntype="File" />

            <p>In this example, it is likely that there are various ethernet cables, perhaps terminated and plugged into wall outlets, connecting to wires led through the building and led to closets with punch-down panels and patch cables, but the data relevant to the drawing was the equipment and how it was connected, so those details were abstracted with simple straight lines drawn between them.</p>
            <p>By extension offices in another building, or remote branch offices might all need to be part of the same logical network but part of those "straight line" connections, might require connecting over a wide-area-network (WAN) or across the internet itself, which is also an abstraction of protocols and various hardware and transmedia.</p>
            <p>Rather than worry about the details of the telephone lines and fiber-optic cables and communications switching companies and service providers, which are indeed <em>important</em>, they are abstracted, meaning the complexities have been left off and a big cover thrown over it and all of those details were wrapped up in a big mysterious ball that was illustrated in the form of a line drawing of a raincloud. It was understood that there was a lot of important detail and <em>stuff</em> going on in there, but it was not relevant to the purpose for the drawing.</p>

        <h3 class="alert"><em>So is it just the internet?</em></h3>
        <p><em>Well, not quite.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/501032/files/60115144/preview" alt="This guy is too afraid to ask" width="300" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/501032/files/60115144" data-api-returntype="File" />
        <p>This image of a cloud was in common use as an abstraction for all the detail that was between points of interest. Sometimes that included telecom switches and routers and firewalls, and over time, this concept also included servers and <em>services</em> that were beyond the scope of the local diagram.</p>
        <p>So this "Cloud" <strong>abstraction</strong> became more than just the communications link but with the addition of servers, it is also the computing capabilities that is available on the internet. An abstraction is just a way of describing a complex idea in simpler terms.</p>

        <h3 class="alert"><em>Then what does it do?</em></h3>
        <p>Let's talk about what a <strong>server</strong> is.</p>
        <p>There are many definitions and contexts. Computer hardware that is designed to be accessed by multiple concurrent users and operate for long periods of time without interuption usually has optimized power supplies and cooling capabilities and maybe extra network interfaces.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it is the computer hardware that we think of as a server. Sometimes it is the <em>services</em> running on the computer.</p>
        <p>This is <em>my</em> definition.</p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">A <strong>server</strong> is a process which delivers an expected, correct response from a well-formed request.</p>
        <p>A browser asks a web server for a page. A customer can order cup of coffee in a coffee shop. A vending machine may sell candy bars. By this definition, all of these are servers.</p>
        <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/501032/files/60115264/preview" alt="Beer Server" width="300" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/501032/files/60115264" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
        <p>Do you agree with my definition of a <strong>server</strong>?</p>

        <h3 class="alert"><em>Internet Services?</em></h3>
        <p>Again, a little history is helpful. The internet introduced a collection of useful network protocols which proved to be valuable enough that many people and organizations rushed to purchase computer hardware to add to the growing network to participate. They used email and stored files and accessed web pages.</p>
        <p>Access was limited and the content was growing, but obviously it was not the capabilities that we take for granted today.</p>
        <p>If you had a business at that time, there was a perception of <em>legitimacy</em> if you had an actual web page. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) had servers to host your pages, but most just provided routing access and registered domain names had to be applied for.</p>
        <p>If your company needed a web site, the most likely solution was to add <em>servers</em> (computer hardware) to the dedicated server room alongside their file servers and add to their team of IT professionals to find their way through. This was an expensive proposition.</p>
        <p>Just as the technology was changing, a new industry was born. The idea was more about the business solution than the technology. Businesses needed internet services without the added expense of purchasing more equipment and hiring more staff to run it. So the cloud was born.</p>
        <p>It was actually the collapse of this explosive growth that led to this new industry. When the famed rapid growth of the so-called DotCom industry came to an abrupt end, as usually happens with unsustainable growth, companies still had a need for the new technologies and other companies finding themselves with computing power which exceeded their needs, developed a way to lease those computing services to others.</p>
        <p>In much the same way that we pay the power company to provide gas and electricity to our homes, we could now piggy-back on one of these company's internet servers instead of installing our own.</p>
