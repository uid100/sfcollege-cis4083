                In the last module, you were asked to create accounts for both Azure and AWS cloud 
                services, and given little to no direction for doing that.</p>
            <p>
                I'm interested in your individual and collective exerience.</p>
            <p>
                In 3 to 5 paragraphs, tell us about that. Did you have concerns about signing up for 
                these services? Was the process simple or confusing? What questions came up while you were doing this?</p>

            <p>Have you already completed the Azure Web App project for this week? After experiencing and 
                planning and forecasting cloud service pricing for development projects, does it change your 
                any opinions or thoughts that you had in your original post?</p>
