                <h2>Virtualization</h2>
                <p class="boxed-paragraph">Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, a server, a storage device, or network resources. It allows multiple systems to run on one physical device, increasing utilization, and providing flexibility and isolation for different workloads.</p>
                <p>Your computer likely consists of a set of input and output devices, some kind of long- and short-term storage capability and a processor to control them, complete processing tasks and control those devices.</p>
                <p>On top of this hardware layer is an operating system which is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer hardware, and controls the execution of application programs. The operating system is responsible for security, memory management, task scheduling, and input/output operations.</p>
                <p>Virtualization enables an operating system to be hosted on a set of hardware resoures that may not be on the same physical system.</p>

                <h2>VNC</h2>
                <h3>An Evolution</h3>
                <p>VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing and is a technology for remote access and control of computers. The concept of VNC was first developed in the late 1990s by the UK-based company AT&amp;T Laboratories Cambridge. The aim of the technology was to allow remote access to computers over the internet in a way that was platform-independent and easy to use.</p>
                <p>The first version of VNC was released in 1998 as open-source software, which allowed developers to freely use and modify the code. This open-source approach quickly gained popularity, and the software was adopted by a wide range of organizations and individuals. Over time, VNC has evolved to include features such as encryption and authentication, making it more secure for use in sensitive environments.</p>
                <p>Today, VNC is widely used by individuals, businesses, and organizations for remote access and control of computers. There are several implementations of VNC available, both as open-source software and as commercial products. VNC is compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, making it an accessible and versatile tool for remote computing.</p>

                <p>Simply put, there were large Unix workstations in the office next door from mine. Prior to this, I could easily open a terminal session, or several from my desktop PC, instead of walking into the lab, but now, I could open GUI sessions to this computer in a windowed application on my computer, and my mouse actions and keyboard clicks would all be passed to the remote machine as if I was sitting in front of it.</p>

                </div>
                <p>And more than that, this VNC server could also run on my PC, so that from my home computer, I could open a client session into my PC at work and like I did with the Unix workstation, I could interact from that remote location.</p>
                <p>Recent releases of Windows include this capability also in the RDS, or Remote Desktop Services. In fact, I'm typing this on my workstation which is a MacBook hosting a remote session to a PC sitting on a shelf across the room.</p>

                <p>There are two keyboards, but they are both attached to the MacBook. Some of you may be aware that there are differences between some special keystrokes and the layout of the Mac and PC keyboards has subtle differences. I do switch between the keyboards sometimes, but they both work in whichever mode I'm working. There's usually a second point device (trackpad) on the desk too, but again, both systems support multiple input devices.</p>
                <p>When I don't need the PC, I can minimize or close the window and use both monitors for the MacBook.</p>
                <p>It was an arbitrary decision to host the PC from the Mac. In my upstairs office, I have a workstation that is set up to use my PC with a USB-C interface to control 2 monitors. Of course I can open a session to my MacBook from a PC there too and still be able to copy / pasted between the two systems. The difference is that I need to run VNC software instead of Windows' RDS, but really they work very much the same way.</p>

                <h2 class="alert alert-info">Virtual Machines</h2>
                <p>So far, we've demonstrated that we can host a remote machine from another computer which may be located in another room, or across town, and use local input and output devices as if they were connected. Cool!</p>
                <p>We started out this discussion with a reminder of the hardware configuration that comprises a typical computer (I/O, processor(s), storage, operating system, other software), and we demonstrated that we can connect remotely and share I/O (keyboard, monitor, etc.) as if they were locally connected. Now consider that the Operating System -which interacts with those devices and launches and manages other software processes- could also be configured to run as a program on another computer. Actually, there is a piece of software called a Hypervisor which will run on a computer, and host another, or several other, operating system(s) on it, as long as the host computer has enough resources.</p>
                <p>Like with the remote computer connection, I can click into the host window and interact with a separate computer, but the difference is, instead of the system running on a remote physical machine, it can borrow processor and storage resources from the host computer. In fact, if I have enough resources, I can have many separate computer sessions running on my computer that only exist in memory.</p>

                <h3 class="alert alert-info">Uses for Virtual Machines</h3>
                <p>So if you can run a virtual machine hosted on your computer or you can use connect to remote computer and operate it within your host computer, why not connect to a remote virtual computer running on a server in the cloud. The virtual machine works the same whether it is hosted on your local computer or the remote server, which is capable of running many virtual machines at the same time.</p>

                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>I have worked on many large government projects and when it came time to deploy these systems, there were always formal test requirements. Not uncommonly, the project would train a group of users, using the official manuals and training materials developed with the project, then sets of computers would be set up, often in remote locations, and these newly trained test players would put the computer systems through their paces. This was intended to prove that the system would perform with multiple users across real-world networks, and that the delivered training materials and user documentation was sufficient for the users to successfully complete the intended tasks.</p>
                <p>As you can imagine, the costs associated with this type of event were high. The training team had to be onsite for some period of time, often weeks. The (many) test players and observers had to be assigned to the task for the duration of training and the formal test event(s). Systems and facilities needed to be arranged and procurred. These events could easily cost in hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if there were tests ahead of time, which needed to be done to discover issues and mitigate risk, the cost would of course be more.</p>
                <p>Imagine that you need to ask your company for budget to purchase perhaps dozens of new computers to be set up for this event. Even large companies might be reluctant to do this. Now imagine instead, you could simply configure a VM as your test client, even script the test inputs themselves, and write a script to repeat this many times. Now, adding another 10, 20 or 50 computers for the test event becomes very manageable and very affordable. Test with 100! And when the test is over, delete them.</p>
                <p>Another advantage of using VMs for testing, is if the software (system) is still in development and has risk of crashing the computers, it's much easier to manage if the "machine" is virtual. The software crashed? If it's contained in a Virtual Machine, then it can only affect that machine and the likelihood of corrupting the host machine is unlikely.</p>
                <h3>Standardization</h3>
                <p>A company with many employees might use virtual machines so that all of their employees will have a pre-configured computer environment that is the same as every other. If a computer fails for some reason, you simply boot up another, and since they are all identical, there is no interruption to work. Maybe it's a customer service center or call center. Greatly reduced downtime and software licenses are easy to manage.</p>
                <p>For classes, I often will create a virtual machine to demonstrate installing software applications to a blank computer, without having to worry about a previous version being installed. In one class, the computers were shared with others outside of my class time, so to avoid data loss, I would connect to my virtual machine in the class, use it for teaching, then close it and reopen it from any other location, right where I left off in class without worrying that someone had changed something since the last session.</p>
