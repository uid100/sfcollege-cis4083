                <h2>Virtual Machines</h2>
                <p>There are two parts to this exercise. You will deploy and connect to Virtual Machines from the desktop and from the cloud.</p>
                <p>You will have some options for this exercise. Also, the detailed instructions that you need may require some web searching. You're encouraged to share notes on the class' Discord channel. I'll add mine there too.</p>
                <p>There are two weeks for this module, but get started as soon as you can.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="desktop">
                <h2>Desktop</h2>
                <p>In this first part, create a local virtual machine hosted on hypervisor. You can do this either with VirtualBox or Hyper-v.</p>
                <ul>Select either:
                    <li>VirtualBox (or)</li>
                    <li>Hyper-V</li>
                </ul>
                <p>VirtualBox is a no cost application available for Windows, Mac and Linux and I have run it successfully on all of these. There are many resources available online to get you started.</p>
                <p>Hyper-v is Microsoft's virtualization product available for Windows 10 and newer. I have not used this, but I have seen the demos for it and for Windows users, it looks like a good product.</p>
                <ul>Choose one:
                    <li>Linux</li>
                    <li>Windows</li>
                    <li>Mac (within terms of EULA)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you've selected the virtualization environment, there are many virtual machine images available for running many different Linux variants, Windows images, or even MacOS. To install the Mac OS on a virtual machine, you will need a product key. This is not an easy hurdle to overcome. Windows images are available for temporary use without license restrictions, but if it will be in use for longer (usually 30 days) then a license purchase is required. Linux images are generally available without a cost. Ubuntu is one of the most popular (Debian) variants. CentOS is also popular - it is a RedHat variant.</p>
                <p>Restoring an OSX (Mac) image to non-Apple platforms is not consistent with Apple's licensing agreements. If you are running VirtualBox on a Mac, this is possible, but you will need to investigate the license issues on your own. I recommend against this to keep things simple.</p>

            <div id="cloud">
                <h2>Cloud</h2>
                <p>Next create and connect to a virtual machine hosted on a cloud server.</p>
                <p>I have virtual machines running on Azure, AWS, and GCP. You can choose any of these. To build your VM.</p>
                <p>Just like you did with the Desktop images</p>
                <ul>Select a host
                    <li>AWS</li>
                    <li>Azure</li>
                    <li>GCP</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>And an image
                    <li>Linux</li>
                    <li>Windows</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
            <div id="submit">
                <h2>Submit</h2>
                <p>Upload one or two screenshots showing your virtual machines running on your PC.</p>
                <p>Here, I have <i>Puka11</i> running Windows from a local image, and <i>devVM</i> is a Windows image running on my Azure account. Both are accessed using Microsoft Remote Desktop from my MacBook.</p>
                <div style="padding: 30px;">
                    <img 
                        src="https://uid100.github.io/sfcollege-cis4083/images/mac-host-vms.png"

                </div>
                <h3>Clean up</h3>
                <p>Don't forget to clean up your subscription when you are finished.</p>
                <h4>Cloud</h4>
                <p>Even though my Azure VMs stop charging me when I stop the service (from the Portal), if they are using a static IP address, there is a nominal change for that. Also the disk storage for the system which can get large if I have a lot installed on the VM, is also a charge separate from the VM image itself. I tend to create these often. Some I start and stop and use often when I need another computer, others, I build for a single task and delete when I'm finished. My usage cost for my frequent use is usually between $5 and $20 per month. If you launch these and delete them again when you are done, your usage should be much less, and more likely within the free usage tier.</p>
                <p>When you delete the virtual machine, delete the <strong>resource group</strong>, rather than the VM itself. The resource group will also delete the disk and release the network resources which might otherwise persist and become recurring costs.</p>
                <h4>Desktop</h4>
                <p>If you won't be using your local VM images, you can delete them also. My Linux VM images typically take up about 4+Gb of disk space each. Since these are located on your hardware, there won't be recurring costs, but if you need the disk space, deleting them is recommended.</p>
