                    The term "serverless" refers to the fact that the cloud provider is 
                    responsible for managing the servers, so the developer doesn't have 
                    to, but the servers still exist.</p>
                <p>
                    PaaS (Platform as a Service) and serverless computing are related, 
                    but distinct, cloud computing models.</p>
                <p>
                    PaaS provides a platform for developing, running, and managing 
                    applications and services, typically offering a complete runtime 
                    environment, development tools, and a hosting environment. It 
                    abstracts the underlying infrastructure and provides everything 
                    needed to build and run applications and services, including servers, 
                    storage, databases, and other services.</p>
                <p>
                    Serverless computing, on the other hand, is a way of building and 
                    running applications and services without having to manage 
                    infrastructure. It allows developers to focus on writing code that 
                    runs in response to specific events or actions, such as a user 
                    request or a database change, rather than managing the underlying 
                    servers. The cloud provider manages the servers, dynamically 
                    allocates resources, and charges for usage, rather than for a set 
                    amount of resources.</p>
                <p>
                    In short, PaaS is a complete platform for application development 
                    and management, while serverless computing is a way to build and 
                    run applications without managing infrastructure.</p>

                <div id="explanation" style="padding: 30px;">
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Let's think about it another way.</p>
                    <p>If you need a task completed, you could select someone at random, teach and train them and then direct them to complete the task. This is the equivalent of Infrastucture as a Service (IaaS). You can specify physical traits, size and strength perhaps, but ensuring that they know what they are doing is up to you.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, you could hire a qualified employee, someone who already understands your business or working environment, then give them the task and supervise the completion of the task. This is similar to Platform as a Service (PaaS). Like IaaS, you can scale certain parameters, and you can adjust them as needed, but the cloud provider ensures that the service is pre-configured to certain capabilities, perhaps as a database or a web server.</p>
                    <p>Finally, you could take that same task and simply hire a contractor, who is responsible for ensuring they assign a qualified candidate, and the contractor will oversee the employee to ensure the task is completed. With this serverless computing, if the coded solution demands more or less resources, the cloud provider can scale and configure as needed. This more hands-off approach is usually more efficient.</p>

                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p style="font-style: italic;">But where/why/when would I use these?</p>
                <p>
                    To put these <em>serverless functions</em> into context, consider the 
                    life cycle of an application.</p>
                <p>Simple console utility applications might be called from the command line, 
                    perhaps take some input from the keyboard or from the system, complete 
                    some processing, and then exit. If they are well-behaved, they release 
                    all of their memory and resources and although they may be kept in 
                    storage to be called again, they are no longer active in the processor 
                    or the computer's active memory.</p>
                <p>
                    A web application, including an API, starts when it is deployed. The 
                    application usually completes some initial definitions and configuration 
                    and then it starts up a listening thread to wait. Don't confuse this with 
                    a web server, which is listening for network requests and then passing 
                    them along to this waiting application. When the web application receives 
                    the http request, it may launch a new listening process before continuing 
                    with its processing to construct the response and exiting, but there should 
                    always be more listeners waiting for more requests (up to a limit.)</p>
                <p class="boxed-paragraph">
                    The web application is running whether there are any active requests or not.</p>
                <p>
                    In contrast. <em>serverless functions</em> are in storage but not actively 
                    running until they are needed. In most cases, this means less processing 
                    time and lower operating cost.</p>
                <p>
                    If you need to automatically send an email to all of your customers on the 
                    first of every month, that might get fresh data from a database call or from 
                    an API, lookup the email addresses it needs to broadcast to, and then format 
                    the message and send the email batch. It might be busy for a minute or so 
                    once every month, but it isn't efficient to keep it running all month only 
                    to check the time a few times each second.</p>
                <p>As another example, a resort's website could display photos, tour information and rates, and maybe poll some local equipment to display current weather conditions. Rather than maintain the connection to the weather station, that interaction could be generated by a trigger sent from the web application, run the functions, return the data and then exit.</p>
                <p>Here are some other use cases</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web applications and static websites: Serverless architecture can handle dynamic web traffic while reducing infrastructure costs.</li>
                    <li>Event-driven and microservices-based applications: Serverless computing allows developers to build small, independent functions that respond to specific events, such as changes in a database or messages from a queue.</li>
                    <li>Big data processing: Serverless computing can handle large amounts of data processing, such as data analytics and machine learning, by scaling computing resources automatically.</li>
                    <li>Mobile backends: Serverless computing can provide scalable and cost-effective backends for mobile applications, without having to worry about server infrastructure.</li>
                    <li>Internet of Things (IoT): Serverless computing is ideal for IoT applications that require real-time processing of large amounts of data generated by devices.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>Triggers</h2>
                    <p>Software triggers are events or conditions in a software system that initiate an action or process. They are often used in database management systems to automatically perform specific tasks, such as updating records or sending notifications, when certain conditions are met. For example, a trigger can be set up to automatically update a record whenever a change is made to a certain field, or to send an email notification whenever a new record is added to a database. They are an effective way of automating repetitive or complex processes and can save time and increase efficiency.</p>

                <h3>More about Serverless Functions</h3>
                <p>AWS calls their serverless computing product <strong>Lambda Functions</strong>. If you've used LINQ in C#, don't confuse these with <em>lambda expressions,</em> they are not related. Google calls them <strong> Google Cloud Functions </strong> and Microsoft has <strong>Azure Functions.</strong></p>
                <hr />
                <p>This discussion offers a little different perspective of serverless computing functions</p>
