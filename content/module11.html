        <p class="ic-flash-info">"<strong>Cloud Computing</strong> is the <strong>on-demand</strong> delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources <strong>via the internet</strong> with <strong>pay-as-you-go</strong> pricing."<br /><em>- AWS Academy</em></p>
        <p>By now, you should be very familiar with the concept of cloud technologies enabling shared services on demand as a business model.</p>
        <p>The historical perspective of comparing <em>how things used to be done</em> with what is possible by migrating to available cloud resources comprises a large part of the cloud business case. To put it simply, it is a bright picture of how cloud technologies can save large enterprise organizations money and improve profit margins.</p>
        <p>But another perspective is at least, if not more relevant, and that is the <em>disruptive</em> nature of the cloud. Small, start up companies and individuals are able to launch into industries and grow and scale according to demand allowing them to compete in markets they might not have entered before.</p>
        <p>Do you want to reach new markets? ...stand up a new internet store front? ...conduct market surveys? ...host a community web service? Now you can.</p>
        <p>Profit considerations and costs, working environments, and customer satisfaction are business strategies don't only affect large companies. These are all important discussion points for startup companies as well.</p>
