                <p>Open the Resource Groups and open the <code>ManagedPlatform</code> blade in the
                    Azure portal.
                </p>
                <p>It is recommended to group related resources within Resource Groups, often by
                    projects. In this Group, there is an App Service plan, a Storage account, and two
                    App Services. One of these is an API, the other is a web app.</p>
                <p>From the Cost Management &gt; Cost Analysis blade, you can see your forecast
                    expenses of using these. Since the storage is not high performance, or large
                    content, the cost is below any visible threshold. Likewise, I deployed both web
                    apps on the Free Tier, so my usage and forecast cost for this Resource Group is
                    currently sitting at $0.</p>
                <p>It's always important to track and manage your billable activity.</p>
                <p>In this case, the next step is to simply delete the resources.</p>

                <h4>Review</h4>
                <p>In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource
                    groups
                    used
                    in
                    this lab.</p>
                <p>It is worth noting that the resource group and all its associated resources could
                    also be
                    deleted directly from the resource group blade in the portal.</p>
