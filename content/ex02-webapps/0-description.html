    <h1>n-Tier Web Applications</h1>
    <h2>Build a web application using Azure web service PaaS</h2>

    <p>For this assignment, setup and configure data in a cloud storage account,
        deploy and test an API to access that data, and deploy a web application
        which accesses data delivered by the API.</p>

            <p>Microsoft provides many online learning resources for their popular
                certifications. You can see the list
                <a style="color: navy;" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/">here.</a>

            <p>The lab chosen for this module demonstrates typical service elements
                of an n-Tiered PaaS web application. There is separation between the
                data, the data access layer, the business logic, and the presentation
                layer. All of the code and the instructions are provided.</p>
            <p>The provided instructions are adapted from Microsoft's AZ-204 certificate
                training material.</p>
            <p>As you click through each of the tabs below, follow the steps and collect
                the required images. Read the instructions carefully. Ask questions
                along the way.</p>
            <p>In the final step of the exercise, you will delete the cloud resources you have deployed. It
                is recommended that you complete this lab in one session. Leaving the resources created will
                incur costs until they are removed. The exercise is designed to mnimize the expenses. All of 
                the labs can be completed well within the trial user account allowance.</p>

            <p>This exercise was adapted from the Microsoft learning materials hosted on GitHub for the AZ-204
                certificate prep. These instructions were originally written with a dependency on a Microsoft
                VM-hosted learning environment. Instead, you will be creating the web service directly from your
                computing environment and using your cloud service account.</p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">Cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before
                this training content updates. If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them
                in the labs as needed.</p>
            <h3>Required Files</h3>
            <p>Check the list of what you will need to get started</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Download and unzip the lab files: <a id="54924978"
                        class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled"
                        href="/course-content/files/AzWebApp.zip">AzWebApp.zip</a></li>
                <li>Log in to the Azure Portal</li>
                <li>Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code *</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No programming will be required for this exercise. The solution source code for this lab is
                provided.
            </p>
            <p>You can use either Visual Studio (Community Edition is fine), or Visual Studio Code. If either is
                already installed, you can skip this step.</p>
            <p>* Visual Studio Code is a cross-platform, free, open source IDE. You can download it from the
                Microsoft download page.
            </p>
            <p>These instructions were written for use with Windows, using another platform should work with
                minor
                adjustments. Let me know if you have questions or problems with any of the steps.</p>
