            <p>
                When my wife and I moved to our first house, it was quite an adventure. The house was in rough condition 
                and in need of a complete overhaul. It was what we could (almost) afford.Over the next years and living 
                in it while we remodeled, we made it into a home. We've since sold that house and moved to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving from an apartment to a house, came with new expenses. On top of our mortgage with the bank, we had 
                to set up utility accounts to establish water and electricity and gas, in addition to homeowners insurance 
                and even trash pickup in the city where we lived.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had been married just a few years, just finished and finishing school, had babies on the way, the budget 
                was tight, and now we had taken on the care and feeding of a house.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of our expenses were fixed. The costs of construction materials was a variable we had some control over 
                and some projects had to be delayed along the way. There were opportunities for extra money to be made at 
                work from time to time and we took them as they came.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm sure this story is familiar to many of you. Sometimes money is tighter than usual, or unexpected costs 
                come along and you take a look at the expenses you can control and those that you can't, and take steps to 
                reduce expenses. Growing up, we were reminded to turn off lights when you weren't in the room, not to leave 
                the refrigerator door open, and only running the heat or air conditioner when it was absolutely necessary.
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Cloud Services</h3>
            <p>
                This story is meant to serve as a caution and a reminder. Lights and heat and electricity are important to 
                have in the house, but those are expenses I can predict and control with usage limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cloud computing offers benefits that you may only start to realize but they also come with expenses that 
                you can predict and control with usage limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the last module, you recognized that there are several cloud service providers to choose from globally, 
                but by market share, three currently stand out from the rest.
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Controlling and Avoiding Costs</h3>
            <p>
                Among my goals for this class, for you to see and use common cloud services on these popular service providers, 
                and for you to be familiar with all three and with what can be accomplished.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an introduction, there isn't time to become experts or to <i>deep-dive</i> any of these in this course, but 
                it is my intent, through experience, that you will feel empowered to investigate more on your own and not be 
                hesitant to use these and others to support your own projects in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                By signing up for these services, you will be assuming some risk, but it will be your responsibility to control 
                costs and limit expenses. The exercises and activities for this class will intentionally be designed to keep 
                costs at or near $0, a precedent demonstrated with my textbook selection.
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">Be careful, not fearful!</p>

            <p>
                For comparison, I have had active accounts with all three of these vendors for close to three years. I have 
                active web applications running and often run demonstrations and tests on these accounts and have only incurred 
                small costs once.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a period of about 3 months, I delayed the purchase of a dedicated development PC when I was beginning a 
                project. I opted instead to create and run a Windows virtual machine (VM) and installed my development tools 
                onto it. It served the temporary need very well. On most days, I stopped the process at the end of my workday, 
                and only started it up when I needed it, but there were many times when it ran for days at a time. I monitored 
                my expenses and scaled the machine up and down to match the performance I needed for the project. My cost 
                incurred for this Azure VM was approximately $10/month for those three months before I completed the project, 
                archived my code and deleted the machine. Later, when the project picked up again, I was prepared to purchase 
                another PC for the task, but I had no regrets for the small cost I had incurred during that development time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do have other web applications and small database applications that I have running on cloud services, but 
                these were built for small projects and are kept within the free-tier.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you run an exercise that creates and deploys a resource with an estimated cost of $13/month, and you run 
                it for an hour, then the cost incurred should be about $13/mo / 30 days / 24 hours or about $0.02. Even if 
                you use it for a few hours, you will probably remain well below the billable threshold in most cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point I want you to take away from this is to feel comfortable building and testing concepts and projects 
                on this emerging global cloud environment, but remember that you are able to control the costs incurred.
