        <h2>Pivoting.</h2>
        <p>
            I asked you to consider the current state of the cloud computing indusstry. 
            It's interesting to me to see it in a something of a historical context. Even 
            with the small amount of data that we reviewed, the differences in some of 
            the results was apparent. Considering the technology is still emerging, it 
            may not be a big surprise that even the top players have changed over not too 
            many years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amazon's AWS was certainly the pioneer. One of the most impressive success stories
            out of the 'dot-com' financial bust of the early 2000s. They were first to market,
            and they have maintained a significant lead in market share. It may be a surprise 
            that IBM, Oracle, and Cisco were early leaders also. Google changed their business 
            model a few times, but were primarily focused on cutting edge research and development 
            when the technology was emerging. Comparatively, Microsoft was late to the game,
            but they have made up significant ground in the last several years.

            The next thing I asked you to do was to visit some of these providers' online 
            presence just to get your initial impressions. Like you, I also have my own 
            opinions about different providers, shaped by my own experiences, but I genuinely 
            appreciate seeing what a new user might see when they first visit these sites. I'm 
            also looking forward to learning about how your experiences influence your opinions 
            over the course of the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week we did some housekeeping. Setting up accounts with the lead cloud providers 
            is both one of the easiest, and most important things we will do. Using a credit 
            card to set up an account feels like a risk. However, all of the major providers 
            have free tiers that allow you to explore and experiment without incurring costs. 
            It is a necessary first step, but it also should make you a little more invested 
            in the work you are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll share this with you from time to time. I do have accounts with the major 
            providers, which I often use for testing and development, but I rarely, if ever,
            have usage that goes beyond the free tier, unless I am intentionally doing so for 
            a specific purpose, such as a configuration for a production client. I have set up 
            business accounts for companies that need the infrastructure and have discovered 
            very flexible, powerful and cost-effective technology to support their needs, as 
            well as the tools to efficiently manage and predict their usage costs. Again, for 
            student and developer purposes, as long as you are aware and careful, you should
            not incur any costs during the course.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like your parents told you growing up, turn the lights off when you leave a 
            room, and don't leave the water running when you brush your teeth! These are
            simple things, but cloud resources are a billed utility, and easily managed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next the fun begins!
        </p>
        <p>
            It's easy to open a book and read about all the things you can do with cloud resources. 
            As many of you observed and shared, some of these provider websites present so many 
            services and features, it's easy to be confused and overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll take it one step at a time and start building a few things. These will be 
            small examples, but the idea is to get you comfortable with what is possible and 
            to introduce you to the different terminology the different providers use to describe 
            similar services.
        </p>
        <p>
            I said "easiest and also hardest" earlier. Setting up accounts seems pretty straight-forward 
            but if you took too many shortcuts, or didn't complete the process correctly, you may have 
            trouble later. For example, I've had students mistakenly assume that having a microsoft 
            login automatically gives them access to Azure services. And when they try to log in to 
            deploy Azure cloud services, they find their accounts limited. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have difficulty, you may need to revisit the account setup steps. You can always 
            delete an account and start over, but be sure to follow the steps carefully.
        </p>

            Thank you for your initial efforts. I look forward to hearing more from you as we 
            progress through the course.
