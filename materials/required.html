        This course requires students to create personal free-tier accounts with 
        Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. While the college provides 
        student email through Azure Active Directory (AAD), these accounts do not 
        automatically provide access to cloud computing services. A separate cloud 
        service account must still be created. Cloud providers require a credit 
        card during sign-up, even for free-tier use, and this requirement cannot 
        be avoided. All labs and activities are designed to remain well within 
        free-tier limits. By carefully following the provided instructions, students 
        should not incur any charges.
